0,"Chinese-only bus shelter advertising in Richmond is about to be phased out thanks to tweaks the city has made to a contract with a yet-to-be named advertising vendor.Richmond spokesman Ted Townsend told CBC News that a just-signed contract stipulates that bus shelter signs be predominantly English. ""We've had the ongoing issue in Richmond about signs on businesses being in Chinese only or predominantly in Chinese, and there's great concerns and complaints in the community."" said Townsend. Richmond has been trying to educate businesses about the council's preference for 50 per cent English on signs. ""We've always made it clear that it's our desire that signs should be at least 50 per cent English. In this case because the signs and bus shelters are on city land we can take a proactive approach and actually put in the requirement,"" he said.According to Townsend the English requirement was added to Richmond's bus shelter advertising request-for-proposal after a contract with Pattison Outdoor Advertising expired last year. Richmond has been grappling an the on-going issue of Chinese-only signs, exposing the cultural tension in a city where almost half the population identifies as ethnically Chinese.Last year Richmond city council voted unanimously against calls for an English-only sign bylaw and instead launched an educational outreach program to let business know the city preferred signs to be at least 50 per cent English. In 2013 council voted against banning Chinese-only signs, after being presented with a 1,000 signature petition demanding signs contain at least one of Canada's official languages — English or French. One councilor felt the petition was nothing more than veiled racism.Townsend says when the new bus shelter contract is finalized, the company selling the space will be obliged to have ""predominantly English"" posters.""Visually it should be equally English and Chinese, and if not, predominantly English on the sign because that is the language the city does business in,"" he said.

Richmond city council won't pursue 'Chinese-only' sign ban ""We've got an ongoing education program specifically reaching out to businesses to let them know the city's preference which is that signs should be at least 50 per cent in English,"" said spokesperson Ted Townsend.More than half of the population in Richmond is of Chinese descent, and over the years, some residents have expressed concern over signs that are only in Chinese.The business license renewal notice now also includes that message in a special insert in both English and Chinese. The city has also asked UBC students to analyze how other communities deal with the issue, and it will hold a community workshop next month.A city audit of signs found less than three per cent are actually in Chinese only. In 2013, Richmond city council voted against banning Chinese-only signs.

2,"Richmond Mayor Malcolm Brodie says he's surprised his council wants to revisit a potential bylaw on the language used on business signs.Monday's discussion about the city's new sign bylaw was focused mainly on decluttering windows and clarifying the types of signs allowed, until the introduction of a surprise amendment from Coun. Bill McNulty.His amendment called for the sign bylaw to mandate ""that all future signage require a minimum of 50  per cent of one of Canada's official languages."" Chinese-only bus shelter ads in Richmond being phased out The motion passed five to four, with Brodie voting against it.""I was surprised that this idea came up again because as far as I was concerned we had thoroughly debated this issue a couple of years ago,"" Brodie said. ""So this was a fork in the road.""The idea of a bylaw restricting language on signs has come up several times in Richmond, where some residents feel Chinese language-only signs are becoming too prevalent. Richmond won't pursue bylaw on English-only signs Outreach working, mayor saysCouncil debated the issue of a bylaw in 2015 and 2013 but declined to impose a bylaw both times. Some observers said the issue was a symptom of cultural tension, or even veiled racism.In 2015, council instead decided to try an outreach approach by employing a sign inspector to encourage shop owners to include more English in their signage by stressing the potential for lost business from English speakers.The issue of Chinese-only signage has come up several times in the past. ""There's the issue of community harmony: you can either lay down bylaws … or you can work with your community,"" Brodie said. ""They've had really good success in attracting co-operation. Frankly, I think it's a much more satisfactory way to approach the situation.""On Monday, Richmond's legal counsel also raised concerns of a legal challenge to such a bylaw, as it could infringe on merchants' freedom of expression.Next steps June 12Brodie said councilors in favour of a language restriction were reacting to comments from a 2016 public consultation that found some in Richmond still wanted a sign bylaw.On Monday, they directed staff to gather legal opinions and other reports on a possible bylaw in time for June 12's council meeting. Richmond Chinese-language only sign controversy, a sign of cultural tension Brodie stresses there is still ""some distance"" before any such bylaw would become enforceable: the exact wording of such a bylaw would need to be approved, it would need to be voted on by council and then go to public hearing.

3,"About 100 people turned up a public meeting in Richmond last night to voice their opinions on Chinese-only business signs.The City of Richmond is looking for solutions to keep the peace between English and Chinese speaking residents who have varying views on the issue, which has sparked debate in recent years.Some people at the forum said they felt they were being excluded and suggested the city should consider a bylaw mandating signs be at least 50 percent English.However last fall city staff  looked into whether creating a bylaw to require English-only signs would be enforceable and they found that could violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.Municipalities have the right to regulate signs that pertain to rezoning and development permit applications, but that regulation cannot be used to control business licences, or sign permits, they found.In the past three years, only 50 of 1,180 permits issued were for signs that were only in a language other than English, according to the staff.Others at the forum wanted to see a more educational approach to the issue, which they said is symptomatic of a lack of integration and communication between communities.Richmond Mayor Malcolm Brodie was at the forum and said the city is trying to find cultural harmony, but it will take some research.City staff are also hosting an online forum to get more comments and are looking into how other cities handle the issue. Their report to council is expected in the next couple of months.Last year Richmond City Council voted against a ban on Chinese-only signs.

4,"The city council in Richmond, B.C., has voted not to follow up on a petition, presented to them on Monday evening, asking for a bylaw that would ban ""Chinese-only"" signs in the city.A group of Richmond residents collected 1,000 signatures supporting their position that the majority of signs in any one area of the city should have at least one of Canada's official languages — English or French.Petitioner Anne Merdinyan spent months taking photos around Richmond to illustrate the prevalence of Chinese-only signs outside local businesses, on restaurant menus and in pamplets and inserts received in the mail. She presented the photos in a slideshow to council.Merdinyan said Chinese-only signs are doing non-Chinese residents a disservice.""We, the new visible minorities, are experiencing exclusion,"" she said to a city council chamber packed with Richmond residents.""Maybe I want to do business with them,"" Merdinyan said. ""Why I have to be an outsider? What's the reason?""On Monday, Coun. Chak Au suggested the city investigate the issue further. However, every other councillor defeated the proposal, saying it's up to store owners to decide what kind of signage they want, and it's up to shoppers to decide if they want to go elsewhere.Richmond resident Randolf Richardson was at the meeting and said he was happy with council's decision.""There are also requirements in our charter that require certain government departments and the education system to provide English and French language support because those are official languages in that regard,"" he said.""But that doesn't extend to imposing those languages on people, private citizens or private property. And what I see these shopkeepers doing is exercising their right to freedom of expression.""Coun. Derek Dang said non-English signs are actually quite rare — a recent count only found three Chinese business signs that had no English.Dang said he's afraid the push against Chinese-only signs may be a case of veiled racism.However, he said he thinks those who support mandatory English signs are in a slim minority.""I don't believe that is a common theme throughout our city, and hopefully it's not around the Lower Mainland either,"" he said.Dang also said Richmond's small business owners should be able to decide how they want to advertise, even if it hurts their businesses in the end.""If they only want to cater to one group of people, [they] are actually doing a detriment to their own business, and I just think it's foolhardy, quite frankly,"" he said.According to Statistics Canada, about half of Richmond's population speaks only English at home.

A motion was subsequently rejected by city council to enact such a law.The City of Richmond has said that before any bylaw is reconsidered, there would be an effort to educate and communicate with residents the advantages of including English on their signs. Despite that, Tung says there needs to be a voice that can mediate the discussion.""I think we need to show to everyone that the community is part of the improvement efforts to make a change.

I believe that it's for both of us. Otherwise, you feel like you're being taken over.""Graham has lived in Richmond for 20 years, and she believes having English on all signs would help build a more inclusive community.Chinese-only signs are 3.5% of total business signsLast fall, Richmond city council asked staff to look into the issue. They counted how many Chinese-only signs are in the city, which amounted to 31, and whether creating a bylaw to require English-only signs would be enforceable.They found the bylaw could violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Municipalities have the right to regulate signs that pertain to rezoning and development permit applications, but that regulation cannot be used to control business licences, or sign permits.A sign of cultural tensionsLongtime Richmond resident Albert Lo argues the controversy around Chinese-only signs might be a pretext for other contentious issues.""There are those issues of visibility.
